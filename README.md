# What is this
This is a shell that I am writing, some of the code came over from my cppshell repo, but 99% of that code was horrid and broken.
So this repo is aiming to be an improvement upon that.
I have also fixed some silly errors, like the environment table rubbish, what was completely broken in the other shell.

# Bugs
exit() only works when it wants to, sometimes takes a few calls to work (possibly a fork error)

# TODO
Build copy properly
